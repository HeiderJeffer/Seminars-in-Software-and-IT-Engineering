# Problem to be solved
1. Students need to know places where they can study when the library is full
2. The most critical period is the exam session
3. Our application helps the students to know where are the available rooms in a specific time
 
 
 
 
 # Software Requirements 
 
 
 ## Main goal
Show available rooms at a given point in time
## Additional: 
1. Show the period of time a room is free and where the room is
2. Show rooms that are available during a specified time range
3. Show availability of a specific room on a specific day
4. Filter rooms by building
5. The application should run on multiple platforms (mobile and desktop)
